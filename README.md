# Bus-Mall Application

Project by: Andres Mills Gallego

Lab 11 - Bus Mall application

This was a fun lab that taught us about `localStorage` and making useful applications for real life situations.  
It was frustrating at times, but was a lot of fun.  

We also learned and implemented Chart.js as a way to show the data collected.  Chart.js is not as intuitive as other things we have used in the past, but it was a great tool to get some experience with.
